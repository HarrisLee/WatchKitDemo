# WatchKitDemo
This demo was created for a WatchKit + iOS tutorial which can be found on Crittercism’s blog here: http://www.crittercism.com/blog/how-to-build-an-apple-watchkit-app

## About the project
There are two main components, an iPhone app and a Watch Extension. The iPhone app gathers the user’s location and speed, which then is sent to the watch for display on the user’s wrist. It’s short and sweet, but gets you exposed to how WatchKit works, and you walk away with a fully-functional app!
